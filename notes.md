# API Tests

API testing is a type of software testing that is done to make sure that the said API is fulfilling its expected *functionality*, *security*, *performance*, and *reliability*.

Some questions to keep in mind before testing: 
 - What endpoints are available for testing?
 - What response codes are expected for successful and unsuccessful requests?
 - Which error message is expected to appear in the body of an unsuccessful request?
